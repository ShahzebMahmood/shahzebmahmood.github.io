# GitHub Actions Security Hardening â€” What I Actually Use

I tightened my pipelines without slowing anyone down. This is the short list that stuck for me across personal projects and DevOps work.

## What I Secured First
- OIDC to AWS/Azure/GCP (no longâ€‘lived keys), leastâ€‘privilege roles
- Required reviews on workflow changes and branch protection on `main`
- Dependency + secret scanning on every PR

## Reusable Workflows That Helped
- `lint-test-build.yml` that app repos call with `workflow_call`
- `plan.yml` for IaC PRs; `apply.yml` on `main` with manual approval

```yaml
# .github/workflows/lint-test-build.yml (snippet)
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write
on:
  workflow_call:
jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20 }
      - run: pnpm i && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
```

## OIDC Role Examples (conceptual)
- AWS: role trust on `token.actions.githubusercontent.com` with conditions like `repo:owner/name` and `ref:refs/heads/main`
- Azure/GCP: workload identity bindings with minimal scopes and short session lifetimes

```yaml
# Example: minimal permissions in a job
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
```

## What Broke (and How I Fixed It)
- Token audience mismatch â†’ set `audience` explicitly on the cloud side
- Excess default permissions â†’ trim `permissions:` per job instead of repoâ€‘wide
- Secret sprawl â†’ moved to OIDC + perâ€‘env roles; kept only nonâ€‘cloud secrets in store

## My Take
I think CI/CD can be good, but it comes with a lot of troubleshooting. I cannot tell you the amount of debugging I had to do ðŸ˜…
