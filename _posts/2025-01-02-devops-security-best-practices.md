# Implementing Security in DevOps: A Shift-Left Approach

Security shouldn't be an afterthought in your DevOps pipeline. Here's how I implement security practices throughout the development lifecycle at Seqera Labs.

## Key Principles

### 1. Security as Code
- Infrastructure security baselines in Terraform
- Automated compliance checks
- Version-controlled security policies

### 2. Early Vulnerability Detection
- Container scanning with Trivy in CI/CD pipelines
- Static code analysis integration
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### 3. Secrets Management
- External Secrets Operator (ESO) for Kubernetes
- Automated secret rotation
- Zero-trust secret handling

## Tools and Technologies

- **Trivy**: Container and IaC vulnerability scanning
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code with security modules
- **External Secrets Operator**: Kubernetes secrets management
- **Google SecOps**: Real-time monitoring and threat detection

## Implementation Strategy

Coming from experience building secure pipelines, the key is to integrate security checks at every stage without slowing down development velocity.
