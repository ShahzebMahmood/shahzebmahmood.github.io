# Bug Bounties as a Hobby: What Keeps Me Consistent

I treat bug bounties as a hobby that sharpens my security mindset outside of day-to-day DevOps work. It is one of the best ways I have found to stay curious, practice responsibly, and keep learning through real systems.

## Why I Do It

I started bug bounty hunting because I wanted practical exposure to how real applications break. Labs and CTFs are valuable, but bug bounty programs add realistic constraints:

- Strict scope boundaries
- Real disclosure expectations
- Production-grade targets
- High signal-to-noise triage

It pushes me to think clearly and communicate findings professionally.

## My Hobby Workflow

I keep a simple process so I do not burn out:

1. Pick one scoped program
2. Spend time on reconnaissance and mapping
3. Focus on one attack surface at a time
4. Document everything while testing
5. Submit clear reports with reproducible steps

Even when I do not find valid issues, I still improve my methodology.

## What Helped Me Most

### Staying Inside Scope

This sounds obvious, but it is the foundation of ethical testing. I verify program policy before every session, especially around authentication, rate limits, and automation rules.

### Better Notes

Good notes changed everything for me. I track endpoints tested, parameters reviewed, hypotheses, and dead ends. That reduces repeated effort and improves report quality.

### Focusing on Depth

I used to jump between many targets too quickly. I now spend more time going deep on one application workflow. This improved both learning and results.

## Lessons From Rejections

Rejections are part of the process. Most of my growth came from understanding:

- Duplicate findings timing
- Informational reports with low impact
- Missing proof-of-impact details

A rejected report is still useful feedback if I treat it that way.

## Balancing With Work and Life

Because this is a hobby, I set boundaries:

- Fixed weekly time blocks
- No late-night marathon sessions before workdays
- Clear stop points when focus drops

Consistency over intensity has worked better for me long-term.

## Final Thoughts

Bug bounties have made me a better engineer and a better security practitioner. I ask better questions, design with stronger threat awareness, and communicate risk more clearly.

I do not see it as a side hustle first. I see it as deliberate practice that compounds over time.
