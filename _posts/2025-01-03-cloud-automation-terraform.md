# Automating Cloud Infrastructure with Terraform

Working across AWS, Azure, and GCP environments has taught me the importance of consistent, repeatable infrastructure deployments. Here's my approach to Infrastructure as Code.

## Why Terraform?

- **Multi-cloud support**: One tool for AWS, Azure, GCP
- **State management**: Track infrastructure changes
- **Modular design**: Reusable infrastructure components
- **Security integration**: Embedded compliance and security baselines

## Key Practices

### 1. Modular Architecture
```hcl
# Example module structure
modules/
├── networking/
├── security-groups/
├── kubernetes/
└── monitoring/
```

### 2. Security-First Approach
- Least-privilege IAM policies
- Network segmentation by default
- Encrypted storage and transit
- Automated security scanning

### 3. State Management
- Remote state with encryption
- State locking for team collaboration
- Environment isolation

## Real-World Applications

At Seqera Labs, we use Terraform to:
- Provision multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters
- Automate HPC environment setup
- Manage secrets and compliance policies
- Implement disaster recovery procedures

## Coming Up

Future posts will dive deeper into:
- Terraform security modules
- Multi-cloud deployment strategies
- Testing infrastructure code
- GitOps workflows with Terraform
